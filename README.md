# Danielâ€™s dotfiles

You can clone the repository wherever you want. I like to keep it in `~/dotfiles`. The bootstrapper script will copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dakl/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

There are two initializtion scripts which installed stuff I commonly use on my computers. For macOS, use `init.sh`, for ubuntu use `install-zsh-ubuntu.sh`.
